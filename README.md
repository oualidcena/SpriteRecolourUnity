# SpriteRecolour Unity demo project

This is a demonstration Unity project for [SpriteRecolour](https://github.com/sinbad/spriterecolour).

# Attribution

Thanks to Stephen Challener (Redshrike) and Zi Ye, for the [Sinbad sprite](http://opengameart.org/content/four-characters-my-lpc-entries), figured it was appropriate since it's the 
mascot for an engine I previously created, [Ogre3D](http://ogre3d.org)
