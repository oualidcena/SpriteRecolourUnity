# SpriteRecolour Unity demo project

This is a demonstration Unity project for [SpriteRecolour](https://github.com/sinbad/spriterecolour)
command line tool.

![Example](SpriteRecolourAnimated.gif)

From any sprite, a 'reference' sprite is generated which indexes either a
palette texture, or an array of shader parameters, either of which can then be
swapped to recolour the sprites without any additional copies of the sprite
texture.

This demo has both examples of using 1D palette textures and shader parameters.
The reference sprite is different in each case because for the palette
texture the UV ranges from 0-1 regardless of palette size (with the texture
shrinking), while with shader parameters the indexing is more direct. You
can make either work with one reference sprite with some additional calculations
in the shader, but usually you would pick one approach or the other to make it
simpler, hence why I've shown them as separate examples.

The shader parameter version dynamically lerps between two palettes; you could
do that with the palette texture too by updating the texture in code (it's small)
but the example fits parameters better.

Hope it's useful!

Thanks to Stephen Challener (Redshrike) and Zi Ye, for the [Sinbad sprite](http://opengameart.org/content/four-characters-my-lpc-entries), figured it was appropriate since it's the
mascot for an engine I previously created, [Ogre3D](http://ogre3d.org)
